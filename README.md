Robots have arrived. From factories to space, robots are everywhere. The focus now, is on building intelligent robots that can think on their own and communicate with each other to work as a team. With massive development efforts being undertaken all over the world in robotics, there is a need to have a common framework that allows code and hardware sharing. The framework needs to make it easy for different types of robots to talk to each other and even s 
 
Robot Operating System (ROS) is one such framework, that is the de facto standard for robotics software development across the world. It is open source and language independent, with Python and C++ being its most popular implementations. It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers. 

If you are interested in robotics then learning ROS will let you choose from the affordable TurtleBot, the capable and friendly Baxter , or even NASAâ€™s Robonaut, currently undergoing testing on the International Space Station. With over 100 robots supporting ROS, you are spoilt for choice.

The talk will introduce the basics of ROS, including but not being limited to the following topics:

* Problems that ROS solves.
* Message passing system for communication.
* ROS libraries.
* Visualization and simulation tools.
